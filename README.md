# Bank Account Management Program

## Description
This is a simple bank account management program written in C. It manages client account data stored in a random-access binary file (`credit.dat`). The program allows users to create a formatted text report, update existing accounts, add new accounts, and delete accounts.

## Features
- Create a formatted text file (`accounts.txt`) listing all accounts for printing.
- Update the balance of an existing account.
- Add a new account with client details.
- Delete an existing account.
- Uses a random-access file to efficiently manage account records.

## Files
- `trans.c`: Source code of the bank account management program.
- `credit.dat`: Binary data file storing client account records.
- `accounts.txt`: Formatted text file generated by the program for printing account details.
- `clients.dat`: (Not used directly by the program, may be related data file)
- `trans.exe`: Compiled executable of the program.

## Building the Program
To compile the program, use a C compiler such as `gcc`:

```bash
gcc trans.c -o trans.exe 
```

This will create the executable `trans.exe`.

## Running the Program
Run the executable from the command line:

```bash
./trans.exe
```

The program will prompt you with a menu of options:

1. Store a formatted text file of accounts called `accounts.txt` for printing.
2. Update an account's balance.
3. Add a new account.
4. Delete an account.
5. End the program.

Enter the number corresponding to your choice and follow the prompts.

## Account Data Structure
Each account record contains:
- Account Number (1 to 100)
- Last Name (up to 14 characters)
- First Name (up to 9 characters)
- Balance (double precision floating point)

## Notes
- The program expects the `credit.dat` file to exist and be accessible in the same directory.
- Account numbers range from 1 to 100.
- When adding a new account, the program checks if the account number is already in use.
- Deleting an account clears the record in the data file.
- The formatted text file `accounts.txt` can be used for printing or reporting purposes.
